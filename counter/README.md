# Task: Counter App with Vue

## Fulfill the following tasks:

- [ ] Don't start from scratch or reuse your old solution because this is more simplified version! Sources are provided in the `src` folder of this directory.
  - This version does not reset the bar when exceeds 100
  - There are no keyboard events
  - You can implement those features later as a extra challenge, if you like.
- [ ] Use v-on directive to increase the count data property everytime the main html area was clicked.
- [ ] Use style binding to increase the background of the main area.
  - Tipp: It's realized with css custom properties
- [ ] Use v-on directive on the reset button to reset the count to `0`.
